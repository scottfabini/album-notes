This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
It is also based on the book [React Up and Running](https://github.com/stoyan/reactbook). All js/jsx code was entered, debugged, and thoroughly commented by hand. As my focus was learning React/JSX/ES6, CSS code was taken directly from the reactbook repository with minimal change. As this was a learning exercise, the commenting is more than usual.<br>
Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
